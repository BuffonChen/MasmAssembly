MasmAssembly

A Sublime Text 3 plugin providing syntax highlighting for x86/x86-64 assembly code in MASM/JWASM style.

This is just a runnable plugin whiich means it works but not perfectly but it works. So I'm happy with it right now.

Since I can't find a perfect solution for asm highlighting, I began with *AkaiBureido/Sublime-Text-MASM-Language-Definition/MASM.tmLanguage* and *Color Scheme - Default.sublime-package\monokai.tmTheme*. Using those two as the syntax reference, I got this plugin, which was just a pain. So if anybody find a problem, please create an issue or a pull request, because you don't want to do it again.
